It is used to group multiple VMobject instances together, allowing them to be scaled, moved, or transformed together.\n\nVGroup provides methods for adding and removing VMobjects. When adding the same mobject more than once, repetitions are ignored. To create a separate copy of a mobject that can be added to the group, the copy() method of the mobject can be used.\n\nVGroup instances can be added using the add() method, or using the + and += operators. Similarly, elements can be subtracted from a VGroup using the remove() method, or using the - and -= operators. When using the operators, a new VGroup is constructed, while the original VGroup is not modified unless the += or -= operators are used.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom manim import Triangle, Square, VGroup\n\nvg = VGroup()\ntriangle, square = Triangle(), Square()\nvg.add(triangle)\nvg + square\nvg\nvg += square\nvg.remove(triangle)\nvg - square\nvg -= square\n```"}]}

This can make it challenging to identify specific videos when there are multiple output files generated.\n\nTo address this issue, a change was made to the Jupyter notebook integration of Manim to generate video file names that are more readable and descriptive. This change includes using shorter and more informative names for the output videos, making it easier for users to identify and locate the desired videos.\n\n\nDetermined the default number of decimal places for NumberLine labels automatically from the step size.\n\nIn Manim, the NumberLine class is used to create number lines with labeled intervals. Previously, users had to manually specify the number of decimal places for the labels on the number line. This could be burdensome and time-consuming, especially when working with number lines with varying step sizes.\n\nTo simplify this process, a change was made to the NumberLine class to determine the default number of decimal places for the labels automatically based on the step size. For example, if the step size is set to 0.5, the labels on the number line will now show at least one decimal place. This ensures that the labels are more precise and informative, providing a better representation of the numerical values on the number line."}]}

This could result in errors or unexpected behavior when using certain features of Manim that rely on the pillow library.\n\nTo address this issue, the pillow library was fixed to version <8.3.0, ensuring compatibility with Manim and resolving any issues or errors related to the pillow library.\n\n\nFixed a bug when using the Text class with the OpenGL renderer.\n\nIn Manim, the Text class is used to create text objects that can be displayed in animations. However, there was a bug that caused incorrect rendering of text when using the OpenGL renderer.\n\nTo fix this bug, changes were made to the Text class and the OpenGL renderer to ensure that text is rendered correctly and accurately when using the OpenGL renderer. This ensures that text objects are displayed properly in animations and there are no rendering issues or errors.\n\n\nFixed a bug that caused fill and stroke colors to be ignored for SVGMobject.\n\nIn Manim, the SVGMobject class is used to import and display SVG files in animations. However, there was a bug that caused the fill and stroke colors specified in the SVG files to be ignored, resulting in incorrect or missing colors in the rendered SVG objects.\n\nTo fix this bug, changes were made to the SVGMobject class to correctly apply the fill and stroke colors specified in the SVG files. This ensures that the colors in SVG files are accurately displayed in animations, providing a more faithful representation of the original SVG files.\n\n\nFixed an accidental displacement issue in Axes caused by include_numbers / numbers_to_include.\n\nIn Manim, the Axes class is used to create coordinate axes with labeled ticks. However, there was a bug that caused an accidental displacement of the axes when using the include_numbers or numbers_to_include parameters.\n\nTo fix this bug, changes were made to the Axes class to ensure that the inclusion of numbers on the axes does not cause any accidental displacement or misalignment. This ensures that the axes are correctly positioned and aligned with the labeled ticks, providing a more accurate representation of the coordinate system.\n\n\nFixed a missing numpy import in the OpenGL shader example.\n\nIn Manim, the OpenGL renderer can be used to create visually appealing animations with hardware acceleration. However, there was a bug in the OpenGL shader example that caused a missing import statement for the numpy library.\n\nTo fix this bug, the missing numpy import statement was added to the OpenGL shader example, allowing the example to run without any errors or missing dependencies. This ensures that users can successfully run the OpenGL shader example and explore the capabilities of the OpenGL renderer in Manim.\n\n\nFixed bugs and added examples to methods and classes in manim.mobject.matrix.\n\nIn Manim, the manim.mobject.matrix module provides functionality for working with matrices in animations. However, there were several bugs and inconsistencies in the implementation of the methods and classes within the manim.mobject.matrix module.\n\nTo improve the reliability and usability of the manim.mobject.matrix module, various bugs were fixed and examples were added to the methods and classes. This ensures that the matrix-related functionality in Manim is more robust, reliable, and well-documented, making it easier for users to work with matrices in their animations.\n\n\nFixed tick issues and improved tick placement for NumberLine.\n\nIn Manim, the NumberLine class is used to create number lines with labeled ticks. However, there were several issues with the tick placement and labeling on the number line, resulting in inconsistent or incorrect tick positions and labels.\n\nTo address these issues, changes were made to the NumberLine class to fix the tick placement and ensure consistent and accurate labeling of the ticks on the number line. This ensures that number lines in Manim have correctly positioned ticks with accurate labels, providing a more precise and visually appealing representation of numerical values on the number line.\n\n\nUn-flipped the output of get_frame() when using the OpenGL renderer.\n\nIn Manim, the get_frame() method is used to get the current frame of an animation as a numpy array. However, when using the OpenGL renderer, the get_frame() method returned flipped frames, resulting in upside-down or flipped animations when saving frames or videos.\n\nTo fix this issue, changes were made to the OpenGL renderer to ensure that the frames returned by the get_frame() method are not flipped. This ensures that the get_frame() method returns frames that are consistent with the original animation, allowing users to save frames or videos without any unintended flipping or inversion.\n\n\nFixed the output of automatically detected LaTeX errors.\n\nIn Manim, the autodetection of LaTeX errors is an important feature that helps users identify and fix LaTeX syntax errors in their math expressions. However, there was a bug that caused incorrect or misleading error messages to be displayed when autodetecting LaTeX errors.\n\nTo address this issue, changes were made to the LaTeX error detection mechanism in Manim to provide more accurate and informative error messages. This ensures that users can easily identify and fix LaTeX errors in their math expressions, leading to more reliable and error-free rendering of mathematical content in their animations.\n\n\nFixed a few CLI and rendering bugs.\n\nIn Manim, the command-line interface (CLI) and rendering process are key components of the workflow for creating animations. However, there were several bugs and issues related to the CLI and rendering process that needed to be fixed.\n\nTo improve the overall reliability and usability of the CLI and rendering process in Manim, various bugs were fixed. These fixes include correcting the incorrect extension for logged gifs, preventing the output of videos when the format is set to png, adding logging for png output, handling conflicts between the write_to_movie flag and --format option, and ensuring that png image output is not ignored when caching is enabled. These fixes ensure that the CLI and rendering process in Manim work as expected, providing a smoother and more efficient workflow for creating animations."}]}

However, as manim was only intended for personal use, it was very difficult for other users to install and use it. In late 2019, Grant started working on faster OpenGL rendering in a new branch, known as the shaders branch. In mid-2020, a group of developers forked it into what is now the community edition; this is the version documented on this website. In early 2021, Grant merged the shaders branch back into master, making it the default branch in his repository \u2013 and this is what manimgl is. The old version, before merging the shaders branch is sometimes referred to as ManimCairo and is, at this point, only useful for one singular purpose: rendering Grant\u2019s old videos locally on your machine. It is still available in his GitHub repository in form of the cairo-backend branch."}]}

It has been developed to be more stable, better tested and documented (!), and quicker to respond to community contributions. It is also perfectly reasonable to start learning with the community maintained version and then switch to a different version later on. If you do not care so much about documentation or stability, and would like to use the exact same version that Grant is using, then use ManimGL. And as mentioned above, ManimCairo should only be used for (re)rendering old 3Blue1Brown projects (basically 2019 and before)."}]}

Additionally, check whether your dvisvgm supports PostScript specials by running 'dvisvgm -l'. If the output does not contain 'ps dvips PostScript specials,' it may indicate a problem. In such cases, try running 'dvisvgm -h' for further troubleshooting information or consult the relevant documentation for your LaTeX distribution."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My installation does not support converting PDF to SVG, help?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is an issue with dvisvgm, the tool shipped with LaTeX that transforms LaTeX output to a .svg file that Manim can parse. First, make sure your dvisvgm version is at least 2.4 by checking the output of dvisvgm --version. If you do not know how to update dvisvgm, please refer to your LaTeX distribution's documentation (or the documentation of your operating system, if dvisvgm was installed as a system package). Second, check whether your dvisvgm supports PostScript specials. This is needed to convert from PDF to SVG. Run: dvisvgm -l. If the output to this command does not contain ps dvips PostScript specials, this is a bad sign. In this case, run dvisvgm -h. If the output does not contain --libgs=filename, this means your dvisvgm does not currently support PostScript. You must get another binary. If, however, --libgs=filename appears in the help, that means that your dvisvgm needs the Ghostscript library to support PostScript. Search for libgs.so (on Linux, probably in /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib) or gsdll32.dll (on 32-bit Windows, probably in C:\\windows\\system32) or gsdll64.dll (on 64-bit Windows, also probably in C:\\windows\\system32) or libgsl.dylib (on MacOS, probably in /usr/local/lib or /opt/local/lib). Please look carefully, as the file might be located elsewhere, e.g. in the directory where Ghostscript is installed. When you have found the library, try (on MacOS or Linux) export LIBGS=<path to your library including the file name> dvisvgm -l or (on Windows) set LIBGS=<path to your library including the file name> dvisvgm -l. You should now see ps dvips PostScript specials in the output. Refer to your operating system\u2019s documentation to find out how you can set or export the environment variable LIBGS automatically whenever you open a shell. As a last check, you can run dvisvgm -V1 (while still having LIBGS set to the correct path, of course.) If dvisvgm can find your Ghostscript installation, it will be shown in the output together with the version number. If you do not have the necessary library on your system, please refer to your operating system\u2019s documentation to find out where you can get it and how you have to install it.

For example:\n\noctahedron = Octahedron(edge_length = 3)\noctahedron.graph[0].set_color(RED)\noctahedron.faces[2].set_color(YELLOW)\n\nIn this example, we create an Octahedron object with a specified edge length.

ThreeDScene now supports 3dillusion_camera_rotation, and z_index was added for manipulating the depth of objects on the scene. The VDict class was introduced, which is to a VGroup what a dict is to a list. Scene-caching feature was also added, so if a partial movie file remains unchanged in the code, it isn't rendered again. Most get_ and set_ methods were removed in favor of instance attributes and properties. The Container class was made into an AbstractBaseClass, and the TextMobject and TexMobject objects were deprecated in favor of Tex and MathTex. A Variable class was added for displaying text that continuously updates to reflect the value of a python variable. The Tex and MathTex objects now allow specifying a custom TexTemplate using the template keyword argument. VGroup can now print the class names of contained mobjects, and VDict can print the internal dict of mobjects. All the standard easing functions were also added. Scene now renders when Scene.render() is called rather than upon instantiation, and ValueTracker now supports increment using the += operator. PangoText was added for rendering texts using Pango."}]}

If the problem you have found is not listed there yet (use the search function; also check whether there is a corresponding closed issue, it is possible that your problem has already been resolved and will be fixed with the next release), please consider the following steps to submit a new issue.\n\nNote\nIf you are unsure whether or not you should file a new issue for some odd behavior that you found, feel free to ask the community developers, preferably in one of our #manim-dev channels in our Discord.\n\nMake sure you are running the latest released version of Manim, your problem might otherwise already be fixed in a more recent version. Check the Changelog for a full list of changes between Manim releases.\n\nChoose the correct category for your report when creating a new issue.\n\nWe have dedicated issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and installation issues. If your report falls into one of these categories, read the issue template carefully! Instructions are given in the <!-- ... --> sections of the text field. If you want to suggest a new feature without concrete implementation details, see the instructions given in this answer.\n\nFor bug reports: prepare a minimal example that can be used to illustrate the issue. Examples with hundreds of lines are very inefficient and tedious to debug. Your problem needs to be reproducible for others, so please make sure to prepare a suitable example.\n\nThis is mentioned in the bug report template as well, but it is very important: if you report that some code raises an error, make sure to include the full terminal output, from the command you used to run the library up to and including the last line with the error message.

ShowPassingFlashWithThinningStrokeWidth was moved to the indication module.\n\n- Upgrades to CoordinateSystem and graphing. Breaking changes were introduced to Axes, ThreeDAxes, NumberPlane, and NumberLine. These classes now use lists to construct their ranges instead of explicitly defining the minimum, maximum, and step values. For example, x_range is used instead of x_min, x_max, and x_step. NumberLineOld was introduced to continue support for GraphScene.\n\n- Refactoring of the Command Line Interface to use Click instead of Argparse. This change breaks the CLI API and introduces changes to the structure of Manim Community's commands, options, and arguments.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are there different versions of Manim?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Manim was originally created by Grant Sanderson as a personal project and for use in his YouTube channel, 3Blue1Brown. As his channel gained popularity, many grew to like the style of his animations and wanted to use manim for their own projects. However, as manim was only intended for personal use, it was very difficult for other users to install and use it. In late 2019, Grant started working on faster OpenGL rendering in a new branch, known as the shaders branch. In mid-2020, a group of developers forked it into what is now the community edition; this is the version documented on this website. In early 2021, Grant merged the shaders branch back into master, making it the default branch in his repository \u2013 and this is what manimgl is. The old version, before merging the shaders branch is sometimes referred to as ManimCairo and is, at this point, only useful for one singular purpose: rendering Grant\u2019s old videos locally on your machine. It is still available in his GitHub repository in form of the cairo-backend branch. To summarize:\n\n-Manim, or ManimCE refers to the community maintained version of the library. This is the version documented on this website; the package name on PyPI is manim.\n-ManimGL is the latest released version of the version of the library developed by Grant \u201c3b1b\u201d Sanderson. It has more experimental features and breaking changes between versions are not documented. Check out its documentation here; on PyPI the package name is manimgl.\n-ManimCairo is the name that is sometimes used for the old, pre-OpenGL version of manimgl. The latest version of it is available on PyPI as manimlib, but note that if you intend to use it to compile some old project of Grant, you will likely have to install the exact version from the time the project was created from source.\n\n"}]}
